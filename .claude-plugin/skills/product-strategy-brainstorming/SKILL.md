# Product Strategy & Feature Brainstorming

Transform scattered product ideas into a prioritized, validated roadmap. This skill provides frameworks for generating, evaluating, and specifying features systematically.

## When to Use This Skill

- Brainstorming new feature ideas
- Prioritizing what to build next
- Creating PRDs for implementation
- Evaluating feature requests from users
- Planning quarterly roadmaps
- Deciding between competing priorities

---

## Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework

Before building features, understand the underlying job customers are trying to accomplish.

### The JTBD Statement Format

```
When [SITUATION],
I want to [MOTIVATION],
so I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME].
```

### Thoven JTBD Examples

```
TEACHER JOBS
════════════════════════════════════════════════

JOB 1: Progress Communication
─────────────────────────────
When a parent asks how their child is doing,
I want to provide specific, evidence-based feedback,
so I can demonstrate my value and keep them engaged.

JOB 2: Schedule Management
─────────────────────────────
When a student cancels last-minute,
I want to quickly fill that slot,
so I can maintain my income and help another student.

JOB 3: Student Motivation
─────────────────────────────
When a student loses interest in practice,
I want to identify what's causing the disconnect,
so I can adjust my approach before they quit.

JOB 4: Professional Growth
─────────────────────────────
When I hit a ceiling with my current students,
I want to expand my reach efficiently,
so I can grow my studio without burning out.
```

### Job Map: The Hiring Process

Customers "hire" products to do jobs. Map the full hiring journey:

## Feature Prioritization: RICE Framework

Score every feature idea on four dimensions:

### The Formula

```
RICE SCORE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

### Dimension Definitions

### RICE Scoring Template

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| Auto progress reports | 10 | 3 | 80% | 2 | 12 |
| Gamification XP | 10 | 1 | 50% | 1 | 5 |
| Marketplace SEO | 20 | 2 | 60% | 1 | 24 |
| Parent mobile app | 10 | 2 | 40% | 3 | 2.7 |

**Calculation example:**
Auto progress reports = (10 × 3 × 0.80) / 2 = 12

---

## ICE Framework (Faster Alternative)

When you need quick prioritization without detailed analysis:

### The Formula

```
ICE SCORE = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3
```

### Dimension Definitions

| Dimension | Scale | Question |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Impact | 1-10 | How much will this move our key metric? |
| Confidence | 1-10 | How sure am I this will work? |
| Ease | 1-10 | How easy is this to implement? |

### ICE vs RICE Decision Guide

| Use ICE When | Use RICE When |
|--------------|---------------|
| Quick prioritization needed | Strategic planning |
| Early-stage exploration | Roadmap commitments |
| Many ideas to filter | Stakeholder buy-in needed |
| Internal alignment | External communication |

• Does it compound over time?
```

## Brainstorming Techniques

### 1. Constraint Removal

Remove constraints one at a time and imagine solutions:

```
CONSTRAINT REMOVAL EXERCISE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

What would Thoven look like if...

NO TIME CONSTRAINT
──────────────────
"If teachers had unlimited time, what would they do?"
→ Personal video messages to every parent
→ Detailed lesson breakdowns
→ Individual practice plans

THOVEN SOLUTION: AI does the time-consuming parts

NO SKILL CONSTRAINT
───────────────────
"If teachers were experts at everything?"
→ Perfect marketing copy
→ Data analysis of student progress
→ Therapeutic communication skills

THOVEN SOLUTION: AI provides expert-level assistance

NO TECHNOLOGY CONSTRAINT
────────────────────────
"If any technology existed?"
→ Real-time practice monitoring
→ Automatic performance analysis
→ AI that can hear and evaluate music

THOVEN SOLUTION: Build toward this vision incrementally
```

### 2. Worst Possible Idea

Generate intentionally bad ideas, then invert:

| Worst Idea | Inversion | Feature Idea |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Make parents wait a month for updates | Real-time progress visibility | Live progress dashboard |
| Require 10 clicks to log a lesson | Zero-click lesson logging | Auto-log from calendar |
| Send progress in complex jargon | Plain-language explanations | AI translation layer |

### 3. Analogous Inspiration

What do adjacent industries do well?

```
ANALOGOUS INSPIRATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FITNESS APPS (Peloton, Strava)
────────────────────────────────
• Social sharing of achievements
• Streaks and consistency tracking
• Leaderboards and challenges
→ Apply to: Practice gamification

HEALTHCARE (Patient portals)
────────────────────────────────
• Clear progress visualizations
• Appointment reminders
• Secure messaging with providers
→ Apply to: Parent communication

FINTECH (Mint, YNAB)
────────────────────────────────
• Automatic categorization
• Insights from data
• Goal tracking
→ Apply to: Studio business health
```
