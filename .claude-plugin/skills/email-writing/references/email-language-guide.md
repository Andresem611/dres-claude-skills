**Subject:** Thoven Bi-Weekly Update: 2026 Goals & Roadmap

---

Hi everyone,

Happy New Year! We hope 2026 is off to a great start for each of you.

As we enter the new year, we want to share not just what we're working on in the coming weeks, but the larger picture for the year ahead.

**Hitting Our Goal**

In our last email, we mentioned our goal of getting 20 teachers listed on the marketplace before year-end. We're happy to share that even during the busy holiday season, teachers stayed active and we hit that target.

**2026 Focus: Product-Market Fit**

So where does our focus shift now? Our goal for the year is narrowly focused on one thing: **Product-Market Fit**.

The last two months of work have been about building our teacher base so we could turn our attention to the parent side—where the true test of PMF lives.

**What We Consider Product-Market Fit:**

1. **High teacher satisfaction** — Measured by Sean Ellis's PMF benchmark: 40%+ of teachers would be "very disappointed" to lose Thoven
2. **Marketplace liquidity** — 100 active studios/teachers listed
3. **Parent willingness to book** — 1,000 intro calls booked through Thoven
4. **Teacher + student engagement** — 300 active classes on the platform

**How We're Getting There**

We're launching three initiatives this month:

1. **Momfluencer Campaign (NYC):** NYC has the highest density of our teachers, so we're running a strategic campaign with local momfluencers to drive awareness among parents.

2. **Meta Ads Campaign:** After speaking with marketers and analyzing platforms, Facebook consistently came up as having the highest density of the parent demographic we're targeting.

3. **Launching Thovie (Our AI Learning Buddy):** Thovie creates value for students, parents, and teachers alike with automated progress reports, personalized awards, and 24/7 teaching assistance.

**What Comes Next**

Once we reach product-market fit: fundraising and partnerships. More on that when we get there.

Thanks again for your continued support. We hope everyone has a great start to the year in all your endeavors. Looking forward to sharing more progress soon.

Best,
Andres Martinez
Co-Founder & CEO

### Example Email: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Thoven—would love your thoughts on a couple things

---

Hi Vipul,

Hope you're doing well! We'd love to reconnect and get your perspective on a couple of challenges we're working through.

Since we last spoke, we've been encouraged by early teacher interest in Thoven. While we've been able to get teachers onboarded and signed up, one of the key things we're seeing is that because we're not directly in the room with parents, it's limiting our ability to help teachers get their parents and students onboarded as well. This affects teachers' ability to leverage their current student base on the platform. We'd love your thoughts on how to smooth out the parent onboarding process and make it easier for teachers to get their parents and students involved so they can start teaching on Thoven quicker.

Beyond that, we're also working through feature prioritization and want your input on a strategic question: how do you think about prioritizing between competing stakeholder needs (teachers, parents, students)? Specifically, should we focus on building features that competitive platforms already offer, or should we double down on building something completely differentiated?

Let me know if you have any time in the coming weeks—looking forward to chatting and thanks again for your insights!

Best,
Andres Martinez
Co-Founder & CEO

### Example Email: Follow-up

Hi Vipul,

Just wanted to follow up on my previous email in case you weren't able to see it. I would love to find some time to chat about a few things that are happening at Thoven, which I mentioned in my previous message. Please let me know if you have any availability in the upcoming weeks. Thanks again in advance for your time!

Best,
Andres Martinez

### Example Email: Post-Meeting Thank You

Hi Vipul,

It was great to talk again and get your advice on those key questions we've been running into. Thanks again for being open to chat and providing your input, we really appreciate it.

We're going to dive deeper into how we add and differentiate from the current WhatsApp or in-person systems. I think the AI use case we discussed is something we'll begin exploring, as it could be a great early application for our platform.

We'll keep you updated as we make progress. Looking forward to more conversations, and again thanks for the support.

Best,
Andres Martinez
