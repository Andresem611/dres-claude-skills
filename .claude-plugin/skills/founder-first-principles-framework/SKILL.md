# Founder First Principles Framework

Apply battle-tested startup wisdom to Thoven's strategic decisions. This skill synthesizes frameworks from Paul Graham (Y Combinator), Ben Horowitz (a16z), and Michael Seibel (YC CEO) into actionable decision-making tools.

## When to Use This Skill

- Evaluating product direction or pivot decisions
- Deciding what to build next vs. what to defer
- Navigating fundraising strategy and investor conversations
- Handling team dynamics or co-founder challenges
- Determining if current tactics match Thoven's stage
- Gut-checking whether you're building something people want

## Paul Graham: Do Things That Don't Scale

### The Core Insight

> "The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them."

### Application to Thoven

At pre-seed with ~10 WAU, Thoven should be doing MORE unscalable things:

**Scalable (Avoid Premature Optimization)**
- Building complex automated onboarding
- Creating self-serve everything
- Optimizing for thousands of users

**Unscalable (Do More of This)**
- Personal onboarding calls with every teacher
- Manual setup of teacher dashboards
- White-glove parent communication setup
- Handwritten follow-ups after each lesson logged
- Personal texts to check on feature usage

### The Collison Installation

Stripe founders would literally install their software on users' computers while they watched. For Thoven:

- Offer to set up a teacher's entire schedule in the system
- Import their existing student roster manually
- Configure their first automated progress report template personally
- Sit with them (video call) through their first parent communication

### Metrics for "Enough Scale"

Don't scale until you hit:
- 100+ weekly active teachers
- Clear pattern of what features get used
- Repeatable onboarding process (discovered through manual repetition)
- Word-of-mouth referrals happening naturally

### The Hard Thing About Hard Things

Horowitz's key insight: There are no easy answers. Good CEOs make decisions with incomplete information.

**Decision Framework When You Don't Know:**

1. Gather what information you can quickly (hours, not days)
2. Make the decision
3. Commit fully to execution
4. Be willing to reverse if new evidence emerges
5. Don't second-guess—execute

**For Thoven Right Now:**

The hard decision isn't technical—it's focus. With limited resources:
- Do you optimize Thovie AI or build marketplace?
- Do you serve existing teachers better or acquire new ones?
- Do you build for teachers or parents first?

Answer: Ask existing users what would make them recommend Thoven to 5 colleagues. Do that.

## Michael Seibel: The 90/10 Solution

### Core Principle

> "Build the simplest thing that could work. Ship it. See if anyone cares. Then iterate."

90% of the value often comes from 10% of the effort. Find that 10%.

### The YC Framework Applied to Thoven

**Step 1: Identify the Core Value Proposition**
What's the ONE thing that makes teachers' lives dramatically better?

For Thoven: **Automated progress reports that save hours of parent communication work.**

**Step 2: Build Only That First**
Before adding gamification, marketplace, complex scheduling—prove the core works.

Questions to validate:
- Do teachers actually send the automated reports?
- Do parents engage with them?
- Does this reduce teacher communication burden measurably?

**Step 3: Talk to Users Weekly**

Seibel's rule: Talk to users every single week.

```
Weekly User Conversation Template:
─────────────────────────────────
1. What's the hardest part of your week? (Pain discovery)
2. How did you use Thoven this week? (Behavior check)
3. What almost made you stop using it? (Churn signals)
4. Who else should be using this? (Referral readiness)
5. What's one thing you wish it did? (Feature validation)
```

### The Speed Principle

> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."

**Implications for Thoven:**
- Ship features before they're polished
- Get real feedback, not theoretical feedback
- Speed of learning > quality of first version

## Key Quotes to Remember

- "Make something people want."

**Ben Horowitz:**
- "Take care of the people, the products, and the profits—in that order."
- "There are no silver bullets, only lead bullets."
- "The hard thing isn't setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is laying people off."

**Michael Seibel:**
- "Don't build products no one wants."
- "Launch something. See if anyone uses it."
- "Your job is to talk to users, not to talk to investors about talking to users."

## Thoven-Specific Applications

### Current Stage Checklist

- [ ] Are we talking to teachers weekly? (Seibel test)
- [ ] What's our "Collison installation" moment?
- [ ] Have we identified the 90/10 feature?
- [ ] Are we in wartime or peacetime mode?
- [ ] What would make 100% of current users recommend us?

### Red Flags to Watch

1. **Building for scale at 10 users** - Premature optimization
2. **Not talking to users weekly** - Losing touch with reality
3. **Adding features instead of validating core** - Avoiding hard truth
4. **Peacetime behavior during wartime** - Misaligned leadership
5. **Months between ships** - Too slow to learn

---

## Using This Skill

When facing a decision, ask:

1. **Graham Test:** Would I do this manually for every user if I had to?
2. **Horowitz Test:** Is this a wartime or peacetime decision?
3. **Seibel Test:** Can I ship a 90/10 version this week and learn?

If all three align → Execute with confidence.
If they conflict → Default to talking to users for clarity.
