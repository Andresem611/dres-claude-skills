# Customer Obsession & Design Thinking

Transform Thoven from a product teachers use into an experience they can't stop talking about. This skill applies Brian Chesky's Airbnb playbook and design thinking principles to music education.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing new features or user flows
- Diagnosing why a feature isn't getting adoption
- Understanding why users aren't referring others
- Improving onboarding or first-time experiences
- Turning detractors into promoters
- Creating memorable moments in the product

## The 11-Star Experience Framework

Brian Chesky's core insight: Don't ask "what would make this good?" Ask "what would make this absolutely insane?"

### How It Works

Start at 5 stars (baseline acceptable) and scale up to 11 stars (absurdly impossible). The magic happens between 7-9 stars—ideas that sound crazy but are actually achievable.

```

### Application Exercise

For any Thoven feature, complete this matrix:

| Star Level | Teacher Experience | What It Would Take |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 5-star | [Baseline] | [Current state] |
| 7-star | [Delightful] | [Achievable stretch] |
| 9-star | [Remarkable] | [Major investment] |
| 11-star | [Impossible] | [Magic thinking] |

The 7-star version is usually your next milestone.

```

### Phase 1: Empathize

**Goal:** Deeply understand teacher reality, not your assumptions.

**Methods for Thoven:**

1. **Shadow Sessions**
   - Watch a teacher use Thoven in real environment
   - Note frustrations they don't verbalize
   - Observe workarounds they've created

2. **Extreme User Interviews**
   - Power users: What makes them love it?
   - Churned users: What made them leave?
   - Non-users: What's stopping them?

3. **Day-in-the-Life Mapping**
   ```
   Teacher's Day Map:
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────
   6 AM  │ Wake, prep
   8 AM  │ First lessons
   12 PM │ Admin work ← PAIN POINT
   2 PM  │ More lessons
   5 PM  │ Parent emails ← PAIN POINT
   7 PM  │ Planning ← PAIN POINT
   9 PM  │ Personal time (if lucky)
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Where does Thoven reduce pain in this day?
   ```

### Phase 2: Define

**Goal:** Articulate the specific problem you're solving.

**Problem Statement Formula:**
```
[USER TYPE] needs a way to [USER NEED]
because [INSIGHT FROM EMPATHY PHASE].
```

**Thoven Example:**
> Music teachers need a way to communicate student progress to parents
> because they currently spend 5+ hours weekly on emails that still leave
> parents feeling uninformed about their child's development.

**Avoid:**
- Defining problems as solutions ("Teachers need an automated email system")
- Being too broad ("Teachers need to be more efficient")
- Assuming you know the root cause

### Phase 3: Ideate

**Goal:** Generate many possible solutions before converging.

**Rules of Ideation:**
1. Quantity over quality initially
2. Build on others' ideas ("Yes, and...")
3. Defer judgment
4. Encourage wild ideas
5. Be visual

**Ideation Techniques:**

**Worst Possible Idea:** What's the absolute worst solution? Now invert it.

**How Might We...** Reframe problem as opportunity:
- HMW make progress reports so valuable parents request them?
- HMW make parent communication take zero teacher time?
- HMW make students excited to share their progress?

**Constraint Removal:** What would you build if you had:
- Unlimited engineering time?
- Zero technical constraints?
- Access to any data?

### Phase 4: Prototype

**Goal:** Make ideas tangible enough to test.

**Prototype Types:**

| Fidelity | Format | Use When |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Low | Paper sketches | Early concept testing |
| Medium | Clickable mockup | Flow validation |
| High | Working code | Final validation |

**For Thoven Features:**
1. Start with paper sketches of new UI
2. Create Figma mockup of flow
3. Build minimal version in code
4. Test with 3-5 teachers

**The 5-Prototype Rule:** Never show just one option. Create 3-5 variations to understand which elements work.

### Phase 5: Test

**Goal:** Learn what works and what doesn't.

**Testing Script:**
```
1. Set context (2 min)
   "I'm going to show you something we're working on.
   There are no wrong answers. Honest feedback helps."

2. Give task (don't explain) (5 min)
   "Try to [specific task]. Think aloud as you go."

3. Observe (10 min)
   - Where do they hesitate?
   - What do they try that doesn't work?
   - What do they say under their breath?

4. Probe (5 min)
   "What did you expect to happen when you clicked X?"
   "On a scale of 1-10, how useful would this be?"
   "What would make this a 10?"
```

**Key Testing Principles:**
- Test behavior, not opinion ("Would you use this?" is worthless)
- Watch what they do, not what they say
- Five users find 85% of usability problems

## Brian Chesky's Customer Obsession Principles

### 1. "If you want to build a perfect 100, start with 10 people who love you"

**Translation for Thoven:**
Don't optimize for getting 1000 teachers. Optimize for making your current 10 teachers absolutely love you.

**Action Items:**
- Name each of your 10 WAU teachers
- Know their biggest frustration
- Know what would make them refer 5 colleagues
- Personally solve their problems

### 2. "Design the perfect experience, then figure out how to make it scalable"

**Translation for Thoven:**
First, manually create the ideal teacher experience. Then automate.

**Example:**
Before building automated progress reports:
1. Write 10 progress reports by hand
2. Send them personally
3. Get feedback
4. Identify patterns
5. THEN automate

### 3. "Your brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room"

**Translation for Thoven:**
Word of mouth is your growth engine. What story do teachers tell about Thoven?

**The Story Test:**
What you want: "Thoven saved me 5 hours a week and parents actually understand what we're working on now."

What you don't want: "It's another edtech tool. Has some nice features."

## Creating Referral-Worthy Moments

### The Peak-End Rule

People judge experiences by:
1. The peak moment (best or worst)
2. The end moment

**Design for peaks:**
- First progress report sent (celebration moment)
- First parent response (validation moment)
- First hour saved (relief moment)

**Design the end:**
- End of lesson logging should feel complete
- End of week should show impact summary
- End of month should celebrate wins

### The Surprise Delight Framework

Unexpected positive moments create lasting memories.

## Applying to Thoven

### Current State Diagnosis

Ask these questions:

1. **NPS Question:** "How likely are you to recommend Thoven to a colleague?" (0-10)
   - 0-6: Detractors (why?)
   - 7-8: Passives (what's missing?)
   - 9-10: Promoters (what do they love?)

2. **Magic Wand Question:** "If Thoven could do one thing perfectly, what would it be?"

3. **Switching Question:** "What would make you stop using Thoven tomorrow?"

### Experience Audit Checklist

- [ ] Have we mapped the teacher's full day?
- [ ] Do we know the "peak" moment in our product?
- [ ] What surprise delights do we create?
- [ ] Can teachers articulate what we do in one sentence?
- [ ] Would teachers be upset if Thoven disappeared?
